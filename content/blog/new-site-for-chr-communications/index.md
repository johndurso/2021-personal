###### Update: As of June 2020, CHR Communications has closed shop. Site no longer available.

I worked directly with CHR's founders, Kathy and Chris, when designing and coding their new site. This helped tremendously as Chris quickly provided copy and Kathy had their color scheme and design ideas already in mind.

For decades, Kathy and Chris have had a successful graphic design business in Metro Detroit and Charlotte, NC. They've done this without having much of an internet presence. They decided it was time to change that!

Their past site was built on the content management system Wix, which is fine for those who are just getting off the ground, but that was not the case with CHR Communications. So they contacted me with the goal of getting their site designed and built within a couple weeks.

Chris provided the copy, and Kathy provided any necessary graphics. With all of the necessities to begin working on the site, we got to the drawing board! At first they had no clue what they wanted, so I designed and coded a few examples, and we ended up with a responsive single-page site. One page, all the info they need potential clients to know, and contact information for the two of them.

From start to finish, the entire process took just over a week! They're very happy with the finished product, and I can easily say they were some of my favorite clients to work with.
