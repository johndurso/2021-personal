## What is SEO and SEM?

### SEO

SEO stands for **Search Enginge Optimization**. SEO is the process of optimizing your website to be indexed and crawled by search enginges such as Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo so users can find your website easier. This method is entirely organic. This is done strictly in code, hierarchy setup, and meta details.

A basic example of SEO would be:

`Meta title: The Greatest Bakery on the Planet`
`Meta description: Enjoy the best sugary treats at The Greatest Bakery on the Planet, located in Detroit, Michigan. Call (313) 555-5555 for more information.`

`<h1>Tasty pastries in Detroit</h1>`
`   <p>Some description text for the greatest bakery.</p>`

`<h2>Blueberry muffins to die for</h2>`
`   <p>Some accompanying text for blueberry muffins.</p>`

`<h3>Our other pastries worth checking out</h3>`

`<ul>`

`       <li>Raspberry scones</li>`

`       <li>Cinnamon rolls</li>`

`       <li>Poppyseed muffins</li>`

`       <li>Chocolate swirl bread</li>`

`   </ul>`

## SEO vs. SEM

One thing that is not very fun for designers and developers of the web is SEO. In the past, there were plenty of *unorthodox*
ways of implementing SEO:

- Using `opacity: 0; visibility: hidden;` in your CSS for headings
- Text using the same color as your background as seen in [this example](https://old.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/krercw/white_text_on_white_background_for_seo_in_2021/)
- Indenting the text so it's not seen by users `text-indent: -9999px;`

These should all obviously be avoided, along with the many other examples stated in Google's [SEO Webmaster guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/webmaster-guidelines?hl=en).
