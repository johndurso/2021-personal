## Flexbox or Grid?

`display: flex` or `display: grid`... *that* is the question.

###### TLDR: Sometimes Flexbox. Sometimes Grid. More often than not, **both**.

### Flexbox: 

I think *Rachel Andrew* of [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) described Flexbox really well:

> Flexbox is all about taking a bunch of things
> (which have varying sizes) and fitting them into
> a container (which itself has a varying size).

Flexbox is great for a lot of things - but my favorite is laying out dynamic content without having to do a bunch of calculations.

Flexbox is ideal for larger websites and applications, due to its *flex*ible nature and ability to handle a large volume of content without breaking.
